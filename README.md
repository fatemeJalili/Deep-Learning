# Deep-Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Neural Networks course homework assignments. Each folder represents a specific paper implementation. Below is a list of Homeworks along with a brief description of their contents.

### Homework 1

- Part A: Implemented and trained **Adaline** and **Madaline** networks on a moon-shaped dataset

  Results based on the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): \
  ARI for ordinary train: 0.361 \
  ARI for ordinary test: 0.366 \
  ARI for encoded train: 0.462 \
  ARI for encoded test: 0.468


- Part C: **Knowledge distillation** from the **teacher to the student network** by feeding saved logits to the student network
